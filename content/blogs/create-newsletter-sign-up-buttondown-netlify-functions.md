In my last blog post, I share how to create a comment system to a Gridsome site. Now I'd like to share how to build a newsletter signup form which both works for Gridsome and Nuxt.js, or basically for any Vue-powered site deployed on Netlify.Â We'll use Netlify serverless function to send form submissions to Buttondown.

Prerequisites

1. Buttondown account and a generated API Key
2. Netlify CLI installed globally on your machine
3. Existing Nuxt.js or Gridsome static site already deployed on Netlify

<table-of-content :toc="toc"></table-of-content>

Assuming you have your Gridsome or Nuxt.js static site deployed on Netlify, let's proceed to building our newsletter.

## Obtain Buttondown API Key

Log in to [Buttondown](https://buttondown.email) using your account. Click the menu from top right side of the page. From Menu -> go to `Settings` then click `Programming`. This will redirect you to the page where you can find the API key. Copy the API key.

Open your existing Nuxt.js or Gridsome project in VS Code or your preferred text editor. Create .env file in the root project directory. Add `BUTTONDOWN_API_KEY` and set the value to the key you just copied.

Since we're using env file in our project, don't forget to install `dotenv` package by running `npm install --save dotenv` in your project.

## Create a serverless function

Now we'll make a Netlify serverless function that will send form submissions containing user's email address to Buttondown. This serverless function will send request via BUTTONDOWN API.

From the root project directory of your static site, create a new folder `functions`. Inside the `functions` folder directory, create a file `buttondown.js`. Copy and paste the following code to the file:

```javascript
require('dotenv').config()
const fetch = require('node-fetch')
const { BUTTONDOWN_API_KEY } = process.env

exports.handler = async (event) => {
  if (event.httpMethod !== 'POST') {
    return { statusCode: 405, body: 'Method Not Allowed' }
  }

  const errorGen = (msg) => {
    return { statusCode: 500, body: msg }
  }

  try {
    const { email } = JSON.parse(event.body)

    if (!email) {
      return errorGen('Missing Email')
    }

    const subscriber = {
      email,
    }

    const response = await fetch(
      'https://api.buttondown.email/v1/subscribers',
      {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          Authorization: `Token ${BUTTONDOWN_API_KEY}`,
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(subscriber),
      }
    )

    const data = await response.json()
    if (!response.ok) {
      return { statusCode: data.status, body: data.detail }
    }
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify({
        msg: "You've signed up to the mailing list!",
        detail: data,
      }),
    }
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err) // output to netlify function log
    return {
      statusCode: 500,
      body: JSON.stringify({ msg: err.message }),
    }
  }
}
```

## Create a sign up form component

Next, create a sign up form component. From the `components` folder, create `NewsletterForm.vue` and paste the following code.

```javascript
<template>
  <div>
    <form id="newsletter" ref="form" name="newsletter">
        <input v-model="form.email" type="email" placeholder="Your email address" />
        <button>Submit</button>
    </form>
  <div>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    data(){
      return {
        form: {
          email
        }
      }
    }
  }
</script>
```

Make sure to add `ref="form"` attribute in your form.

You can style your form using the CSS framework of your choice, depending on what you use in your project. I use Tailwind CSS to design my form.

My component looks like this:

```javascript
<template>
  <div class="w-screen h-screen grid place-items-center bg-zinc-900">
    <div class="flex flex-col p-10 w-3/4 rounded-md bg-slate-300">
      <h1 class="text-lg font-semibold">Sign up for newsletter</h1>
      <p>Get the latest news about web development straight to your inbox</p>

      <div>
        <form id="newsletter" ref="form" name="newsletter" class="flex justify-between space-x-3 mt-2">
          <input v-model="form.email" type="email" class="w-3/4 rounded-md p-2" placeholder="Your email address" />
          <button class="bg-purple-500 text-white p-2 w-1/4 rounded-md">Submit</button>
        </form>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    data(){
      return {
        form: {
          email
        }
      }
    }
  }
</script>

```

## Submitting the form

Now we need to write a method that will trigger the serverless function whenever we submit our form. Inside the script tag, append the following code:

```javascript

// NewsletterForm.vue

<script>
export default {
  ...

  methods: {
    async submitForm(form) {
      try {
        await fetch('/.netlify/functions/buttondown', {
          method: 'POST',
          body: JSON.stringify(form),
          headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json',
          },
        })
          .then((res) => res.json())
          .then((res) => {
            // do whatever you want here
          })
      } catch (e) {
        console.log(e)
      }
    },
  }

}
</script>

```

Next, add the submitForm handler in our form. Don't forget to pass the reference to our form.

```html
...
<form @submit.prevent="submitForm(form)">....</form>
```

Our complete code should now look like this:

```javascript

<template>
  <div>
    <form id="newsletter" ref="form" name="newsletter" @submit.prevent="submitForm(form)">
        <input v-model="form.email" type="email" placeholder="Your email address" />
        <button>Submit</button>
    </form>
  <div>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    data(){
      return {
        form: {
          email
        }
      }
    },
    methods: {
      async submitForm(form) {
        try {
          await fetch('/.netlify/functions/buttondown', {
            method: 'POST',
            body: JSON.stringify(form),
            headers: {
              'Content-Type': 'application/json',
            },
          })
            .then((res) => res.json())
            .then((res) => {
              // do whatever you want here
              alert('Success! Thanks for subscribing!")
            })
        } catch (e) {
          console.log(e)
        }
      },
    }
  }
</script>

```

And that's it. Our component is now ready. Just import the component to the page where you want it to be placed.

## Deploy on Netlify

Deploying on Netlify is straight forward and I assume you know the process already.

But before we push your code changes to your Git provider, make sure to add `netlify.toml` at the root project directory. This file specifies the path of the folder where you want your functions to be of your site.

```toml

[build]
  base = "."
  functions = "./functions"
  ignore = "git log -1 --pretty=%B | grep dependabot"

[functions]
  node_bundler = "esbuild"

```

Then push your code to your Git provider and let Netlify redeploy your site.

## Test locally with Netlify Dev

If you're adding changes to your serverless function, it's always better to test it first before deploying to Netlify. Thanks to Netlify Dev, this is easy to achieve.

Make sure you have Netlify CLI installed on your machine.

To test the function locally, run the command `netlify dev`. It will start a dev server with hot reload on port 8888.

Try submitting an email in the form. If everything is set up correctly, you should see an alert message with the message `Success. Thanks for subscribing!`.

That's it! You now have a working newsletter sign up form thanks to Netlify serverless functions and Buttondown.
