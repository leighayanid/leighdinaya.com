## About Portfolio v2

This is the second iteration of my portfolio website. It features my most recent web development projects, a page for resources that may be useful to other web developers, and a blog.

All pages were created with Gridsome in an attempt to add performance optimisations. Gridsome is a static site generator powered by VueJS and GraphQL. It dynamically generates pages from your data and is extremely fast.

Unlike my other side projects, I didn't use any CSS framework here, opting instead to do everything from the ground up using SASS and BEM methodology.
